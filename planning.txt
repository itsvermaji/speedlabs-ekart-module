Points to Remember
1. Check for the keywords in package.json.
2. Right now the tot_students attribute in product section is filled by admin, later on it will be dynamically handled.

COUPONS Logic: 
Admin: 
1. user_id should be among institute's students.
2. Valid from date should not exceed valid till date.
3. valid from date should not be prior to the current date of creating coupon.
4. Valid till should be atleast more than current date.
5. Capitalize the coupon while creating.
6. Discount percent and discount_amt can't be applied at the same time.
7. Discount amount cannot exceed the product_discounted price. 
8. Coupon can only be redeemed for once for particular user.
FILTER: for deleting expired coupons.
