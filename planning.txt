Points to Remember
1. Check for the keywords in package.json.
2. Right now the tot_students attribute in product section is filled by admin, later on it will be dynamically handled.

COUPONS Logic: 
Admin: 
Creates a coupon for specific users{ for specific user_id } along with discount{both percent and amount} and issued by which institute, { with specific duration}. 
coupons carry a status which shows expired.


TODO: Visualization using template engine(pug or ejs)
admin side, student side, add to cart, payment gateway, coupon discount, access of purchased product.
